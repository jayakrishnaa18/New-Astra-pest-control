      <h2>Rubbish Removal Versus Skip Bin Hire</h2>
      <p>When you're moving out, cleaning and removing waste come hand in hand. When it comes to junk removal, there are two main options: hiring a skip bin or using a rubbish removal service. Both have pros and cons, so which is the best option for you?</p>
      
      <h3>Skip Bin Hire - The Traditional Option</h3>
      <p>Skip bins are large containers that you can fill with waste over a period of time. They're delivered to your property and picked up when full or after an agreed period.</p>
      
      <h4>Advantages of Skip Bins:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Good for ongoing projects where waste accumulates gradually</li>
        <li>You control the timeline - fill it at your own pace</li>
        <li>Cost-effective for large volumes of waste</li>
        <li>Available in various sizes</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>Disadvantages of Skip Bins:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>May require council permits for street placement</li>
        <li>Takes up space on your property</li>
        <li>You do all the loading work</li>
        <li>Can be an eyesore in your driveway</li>
        <li>Fixed hire period - may pay for unused time</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Rubbish Removal Service - The Modern Solution</h3>
      <p>Professional rubbish removal services come to your property with a team and truck, load everything, and take it away immediately.</p>
      
      <h4>Advantages of Rubbish Removal:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Quick and convenient - same-day service available</li>
        <li>No permits needed</li>
        <li>Professional team does all the heavy lifting</li>
        <li>No space taken up on your property</li>
        <li>Flexible scheduling</li>
        <li>Environmentally responsible disposal</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>Disadvantages of Rubbish Removal:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>May cost more for very large volumes</li>
        <li>Need to schedule in advance</li>
        <li>All waste must be ready at once</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Which Should You Choose?</h3>
      <p><strong>Choose Skip Bin if:</strong> You have a long-term renovation project, need to accumulate waste over weeks, and don't mind doing the loading yourself.</p>
      <p><strong>Choose Rubbish Removal if:</strong> You need quick removal, don't want the hassle of loading, need same-day service, or are doing end-of-lease cleaning.</p>
      
      <p>At Best 1 Cleaning and Pest Control, we offer professional rubbish removal services that make your life easier. Our team handles everything from loading to disposal, ensuring environmentally responsible waste management.</p>

      <h2>How Much Does It Cost To Get Your Carpets Cleaned?</h2>
      <p>Professional carpet cleaning costs vary based on several factors. Understanding these helps you budget appropriately and get the best value for your money.</p>
      
      <h3>Factors That Affect Carpet Cleaning Cost</h3>
      
      <h4>1. Size of the Area</h4>
      <p>The most obvious factor is the size of the area to be cleaned. Most companies charge per room or per square meter.</p>

        <li>Living room: $100-$150</li>

        <li>Commercial spaces: Custom quotes based on square meterage</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>2. Carpet Condition</h4>
      <p>Heavily soiled carpets require more time, effort, and cleaning solution.</p>
      
      <h4>3. Stain Treatment</h4>
      <p>Stubborn stains like red wine, pet urine, or ink require special treatment and may incur additional charges ($20-$50 per stain).</p>

      <h2>Why Termite Inspections Are Essential in Richlands</h2>
      <p>Richlands' warm, humid climate creates perfect conditions for termite activity. Regular termite inspections are your first line of defense against costly structural damage.</p>
      
      <h3>What Is a Termite Inspection?</h3>
      <p>A professional termite inspection involves a licensed technician thoroughly examining your property for signs of termite activity, damage, and conducive conditions. Using specialized equipment including moisture meters and thermal imaging, we identify:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Active termite infestations</li>
        <li>Previous termite damage</li>
        <li>Conditions that attract termites</li>
        <li>Entry points and risk areas</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>How Often Should You Get Inspected?</h3>
      <p>Australian Standards recommend annual termite inspections for all properties. However, Richlands homes may need more frequent inspections if:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Previous termite activity has been detected</li>
        <li>Your property is in a high-risk area</li>
        <li>There's timber-to-ground contact</li>
        <li>You have poor drainage or moisture issues</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Signs You Need an Immediate Inspection</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Mud tubes on walls or foundations</li>
        <li>Hollow-sounding timber when tapped</li>
        <li>Discarded wings near windows or doors</li>
        <li>Sagging floors or doors that stick</li>
        <li>Visible timber damage or frass (termite droppings)</li>
        <li>Bubbling or peeling paint</li>
      </ul>

    content: `
      <h2>Effective Ant Control in Richlands</h2>
      <p>Ants are one of the most common pest problems in Richlands homes. While they may seem harmless, ant infestations can contaminate food, damage property, and some species can even bite.</p>
      
      <h3>Common Ant Species in Richlands</h3>
      
      <h4>Black House Ants</h4>
      <p>Small black ants that form trails to food sources. They nest in wall cavities, under paving, and in garden beds.</p>
      
      <h4>Coastal Brown Ants</h4>
      <p>Medium-sized brown ants that can form super-colonies with multiple queens. Very difficult to control without professional help.</p>
      
      <h4>Carpenter Ants</h4>
      <p>Large black ants that tunnel through timber, potentially causing structural damage similar to termites.</p>
      
      <h3>Why DIY Ant Control Often Fails</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Surface sprays only kill visible ants, not the colony</li>
        <li>Colonies can have multiple queens and nesting sites</li>
        <li>Ants can relocate when threatened</li>
        <li>Wrong products can cause colonies to split</li>
        <li>Nests are often hidden in walls or underground</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Ant Prevention Tips</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Wipe down benches and clean up spills immediately</li>
        <li>Store food in sealed containers</li>
        <li>Take out garbage regularly</li>
        <li>Fix leaking taps and pipes</li>
        <li>Seal cracks and gaps around doors and windows</li>

    title: 'Complete Guide to Flea Control',
    date: '2024-11-21',
    category: 'Pest Control',
    content: `
      <h2>Understanding Fleas</h2>
      <p>Fleas are highly specialised bloodsucking parasites belonging to the order of insects called Siphonaptera, which means "wingless siphon". Fleas will bite only accessible parts of the body and clustered bites on the lower limbs.</p>
      
      <h3>Life Cycle of a Flea</h3>
      <p>Most females will lay at least 100 eggs within a life cycle of several months. The adult fleas emerge from the pupal case in 1-2 weeks but can remain dormant in their cocoons for several months depending on the availability of food and conditions.</p>
      
      <p>The emergence of the adult flea from the pupal stage is generally triggered by vibrations, which can happen when entering an unoccupied dwelling of previous pet owners.</p>
      
      <h3>Treating Flea Bites</h3>
      <p>When fleas are present homeowners generally notice them first by the bites they leave behind. It is typical of flea bites to be concentrated on and around the ankles, and can look similar to mosquito bites.</p>
      
      <p>Fleas can at times be selective and may only feed on one or a few people residing in a house. Children and infants can sometimes be the most affected in the home.</p>
      
      <h3>Treatment and Control of Fleas</h3>
      <p>If you have pets, it is essential to prevent fleas becoming established in carpets and bedding:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Vacuum carpets and furnishings where pets sleep to remove fleas and eggs. Use your vacuum cleaner on a strong suction setting</li>
        <li>Empty the vacuum cleaner bag after cleaning and place the bag into a bin outside of the home</li>
        <li>Washing your pets bedding on a regular basis with hot water will help to kill flea eggs, the larvae, and also adults within cocoons</li>
        <li>Take care when moving bedding, mats, etc, to avoid moving flea eggs around</li>
        <li>It may be wise to place pet beds in areas without carpets such as on vinyl, tiled or wooden floors</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Professional Flea Treatment</h3>
      <p>Warm, humid weather conditions in the summer months provide ideal conditions for fleas to flourish. Flea eggs and larvae may be found where pets feed and rest. These areas should be targeted by a pest technician to gain control of an infestation.</p>
      
      <p>Prior to a pest technician arriving, you should vacuum all floors. Washing the pets and bedding with an insecticidal preparation will aid in the control of fleas and their eggs.</p>
      
      <p>Always use a licensed pest control company when looking for professional flea exterminator to eliminate fleas and their eggs.</p>
      
      <h3>Why Professional Help is Essential</h3>
      <p>Flea pupae can lay dormant in carpets and soil for more than twelve months and can be stimulated to emerge as an adult flea by vibrations. Insects can slow down their growth and development at different stages in order to make the most of favourable conditions.</p>
      
      <p>Fleas will only become active when the conditions are favourable - when the temperature is right and if there is a blood meal available. Fleas feed on blood and need it to survive.</p>
      
      <p>Fleas will breed in any carpet type and have even been known to harbour in the gaps in wooden floor boards. It's important to have all the floors treated with a liquid insecticide to successfully rid a home of fleas.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Important:</strong> Pets also need to be treated at the same time as the property is being sprayed. The best products for this is either "Front line" or "Advantage." Your pets also need to have ongoing flea treatments to keep them free of fleas for the year, usually done on a monthly basis.</p>

    title: 'Cockroach Control: Protect Your Family',
    date: '2024-11-20',
    category: 'Pest Control',
    content: `
      <h2>Protect Your Family from Cockroaches!</h2>
      <p>Cockroaches are a high risk pest to have in your home... They carry a range of serious illnesses including salmonella, dysentery, and gastroenteritis.</p>
      
      <p>The risk is particularly high in homes with children, the elderly or those fighting illnesses. Cockroach droppings have even been implicated as being a contributing factor leading to childhood asthma.</p>
      
      <p>Beyond significant health risks, cockroaches are a disturbing pest to many homeowners. They also produce an obnoxious odor that contaminates nearby food and belongings.</p>
      
      <p>Cockroaches can breed rapidly and are highly resilient. A quick response is essential to prevent cockroaches in your home.</p>
      
      <h3>How to Prevent Cockroach Infestations</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Store food in containers or in sealed plastic bags</li>
        <li>Clean all garbage and spills immediately</li>
        <li>Clean food debris from under refrigerators or ovens</li>
        <li>Clean used dishes immediately after meals</li>
        <li>Remove pet food, water and litter trays overnight</li>
        <li>Keep garbage or compost in sealed bins</li>
        <li>Do not leave liquids in sinks or buckets overnight</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Professional Cockroach Control Methods</h3>
      <p>Astra Pest Control deals with cockroach control using a variety of techniques, tools and products.</p>
      
      <p>First, a professional pest expert will visit the site and do an inspection to determine the details of the infestation (what type of roach and severity of problem).</p>
      
      <h4>Standard Treatment</h4>
      <p>If the infestation is not too major, the process of removal starts with a general spray and clean of trouble areas such as skirting boards, walls, garbage areas, exterior structures, etc. The spray is non-toxic to humans and water-based to ensure no harm comes to homeowners, children and pets.</p>
      
      <p>Then, a dust is distributed throughout the cracks, crevices and wall cavities. The dust we use is very effective because cockroaches come in contact with the substance and tend to spread it to the nest and therefore the other roaches.</p>
      
      <h4>Severe Infestation Treatment</h4>
      <p>If the infestation becomes severe, the same spray and dust treatment is used. However, we put a gel substance in cupboards/trouble areas that stays active for twelve months and is, therefore, highly effective in the elimination of the infestation.</p>
      
      <h3>Recognizing Cockroaches</h3>
      <p>One of the best ways to keep cockroaches out of your home is to keep the kitchen area hygienically clean. It pays to remove the fridge and dishwasher once a year and give the floor and the back of the appliances a good clean.</p>
      
      <p>One main area to try and keep clean in the kitchen is the cupboard hinges, this is where cockroaches will lay eggs and harbour. A tell tale sign that you have cockroaches present in your home is feces droppings in the cupboards and on the hinges.</p>
      
      <h3>Important Note</h3>
      <p>It is important for homeowners to be aware that, in order to keep cockroaches from becoming a serious problem in the future, the areas must be kept clean and tidy to discourage their return.</p>
      
      <p>Typically after a treatment you may see an increase in cockroach activity. This is because some of the pest products have flushing agents in them, making the cockroaches run to try and escape the treatment.</p>
      
      <p>We also dust the roof void with an electric blower. This is placed just inside the man hole cover and the dust settles on the roof floor. This is very effective in eradicating cockroaches from a home.</p>

      <h2>"Don't let the bed bugs bite!" Get rid of bed bugs.</h2>
      <p>For many, bed bugs are just a myth kept alive by goodnight wishes. However, do not be fooled; bed bugs are very much alive and are a constant nuisance for many households.</p>
      
      <p>Bed bugs are a brown/dark red insect reaching to about 5mm when fully-grown. The little blighters love nothing more than to suck the blood from their host's neck, shoulders and arms as they are attracted to the warmth and carbon dioxide of these areas.</p>
      
      <p>Although painless at the time, the bite of a bed bug will often become swollen and itchy, as they inject saliva when feasting which can irritate many.</p>
      
      <h3>Life Cycle</h3>
      <p>Bed bugs are able to go long periods of time before needing another blood feed, which is something that makes infestation difficult to control. The life cycle of a bed bug from egg to death can be up to a year depending on food supply and their environment.</p>
      
      <p>A female bed bug can lay up to 500 eggs in batches of about 50, so infestation is a common problem when dealing with these creatures. Blood spots on bed sheets are often a sure sign of bed bugs.</p>
      
      <h3>Professional Bed Bug Extermination Methods</h3>
      <p>If possible, we first ask the customer to strip and hot-wash linen and to bag and sun clothing.</p>
      
      <p>Our team begins the treatment with a thorough powerhead vacuum of mattresses and carpet. Once completed, skirting boards, cracks and crevices and carpet are treated with a non-toxic spray.</p>
      
      <p>Bird lice are treated in a similar way. In older houses especially, the ceilings tend to expand and contract, creating gaps. If there are birds in the roof, the lice can fall through these cracks onto furniture.</p>
      
      <h3>Life Cycle & Habits of Bed Bugs</h3>
      <p>Bedbugs live in the edges of mattresses. They will harbour deep within mattresses or even upholstery. They will also dwell in the edges of carpets, curtains and even behind pictures.</p>
      
      <p>To successfully treat bedbugs, an intense treatment is needed. A pest control technician should ensure that all areas of an affected room are well treated.</p>
      
      <p>When you hire a pest control company to get rid of bedbugs, you must be sure they have the knowledge and equipment to effectively remove them from your home. Just doing a surface spray will have little effect on these pests.</p>
      
      <p>With a severe bed bugs problem it may be wise to have your carpets and mattresses professionally steam cleaned. This should be done before the treatment is carried out. Astra Pest Control are experts in both pest control and carpet cleaning, so this means both services can be carried out on the same day saving you time and money.</p>

      <h2>4 Ways To Winter Proof Your Home From Pests in Richlands</h2>
      <p>Winter in Richlands brings cooler temperatures, and while we're reaching for blankets and heaters, pests are looking for warm shelter too. Your home becomes an attractive refuge for rodents, spiders, cockroaches, and other unwanted guests seeking food, warmth, and protection from the cold.</p>
      
      <p>Don't wait until you have an infestation. Follow these four professional strategies to winter-proof your Richlands home against pests.</p>
      
      <h3>1. Seal All Entry Points</h3>
      <p>Pests can squeeze through surprisingly small gaps. Mice can fit through holes as small as 6mm, and insects need even less space.</p>
      
      <h4>What to Do:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Inspect your home's exterior:</strong> Walk around your property looking for cracks, gaps, and holes in walls, foundations, and around pipes</li>
        <li><strong>Check doors and windows:</strong> Install or replace weather stripping and door sweeps. Ensure screens are intact with no tears</li>
        <li><strong>Seal gaps:</strong> Use caulk for small cracks and expanding foam for larger gaps around pipes and cables</li>
        <li><strong>Cover vents:</strong> Install mesh screens over roof vents, exhaust vents, and chimneys</li>
        <li><strong>Repair damaged roofing:</strong> Replace broken tiles and seal gaps in eaves and soffits</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Pay special attention to areas where utilities enter your home—these are common entry points for rodents and insects.</p>
      
      <h3>2. Eliminate Food Sources</h3>
      <p>Pests are attracted to readily available food. Winter makes outdoor food scarce, so they'll actively seek indoor sources.</p>
      
      <h4>Kitchen and Pantry:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Store all food in airtight containers (glass or heavy plastic)</li>
        <li>Don't leave pet food out overnight</li>
        <li>Clean up crumbs and spills immediately</li>
        <li>Wipe down counters and sweep floors daily</li>
        <li>Take out garbage regularly and use bins with tight-fitting lids</li>
        <li>Check pantry items for signs of infestation (holes in packaging, droppings)</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>Outdoor Areas:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Keep garbage bins away from the house with secure lids</li>
        <li>Clean up fallen fruit from trees</li>
        <li>Store birdseed in sealed containers</li>
        <li>Don't leave pet food bowls outside</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>3. Remove Water Sources and Fix Moisture Issues</h3>
      <p>Like all living creatures, pests need water to survive. Eliminating water sources makes your home less hospitable.</p>
      
      <h4>Indoor Moisture Control:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Fix leaks immediately:</strong> Repair dripping taps, leaking pipes, and faulty appliances</li>
        <li><strong>Improve ventilation:</strong> Use exhaust fans in bathrooms and kitchens to reduce humidity</li>
        <li><strong>Check under sinks:</strong> Look for water damage or leaks in cabinets</li>
        <li><strong>Dry wet areas:</strong> Wipe down sinks, showers, and tubs after use</li>
        <li><strong>Use dehumidifiers:</strong> In damp areas like basements or laundries</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>Outdoor Drainage:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Clean gutters and downpipes to prevent water pooling</li>
        <li>Ensure proper drainage away from foundations</li>
        <li>Fix any areas where water collects near the house</li>
        <li>Store firewood away from the house and off the ground</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> Cockroaches, silverfish, and rodents are particularly attracted to moisture. Termites also thrive in damp conditions.</p>
      
      <h3>4. Declutter and Maintain Your Property</h3>
      <p>Clutter provides perfect hiding spots and nesting materials for pests. A tidy home is much less attractive to unwanted visitors.</p>
      
      <h4>Indoor Decluttering:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Storage areas:</strong> Organize garages, sheds, and storage rooms. Use plastic bins instead of cardboard boxes</li>
        <li><strong>Reduce hiding spots:</strong> Keep items off floors and away from walls where possible</li>
        <li><strong>Regular cleaning:</strong> Vacuum regularly, especially in corners, under furniture, and along baseboards</li>
        <li><strong>Inspect stored items:</strong> Check boxes and stored clothing for signs of pests</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>Outdoor Maintenance:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Trim vegetation:</strong> Keep shrubs and tree branches at least 30cm away from the house</li>
        <li><strong>Remove debris:</strong> Clear leaf litter, mulch buildup, and dead plants from around foundations</li>
        <li><strong>Maintain the lawn:</strong> Keep grass cut short and remove piles of grass clippings</li>
        <li><strong>Store firewood properly:</strong> Keep it at least 6 meters from the house and elevated off the ground</li>
        <li><strong>Remove standing water:</strong> Empty plant saucers, buckets, and any containers that collect water</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Bonus Tip: Schedule a Professional Pest Inspection</h3>
      <p>Even with the best prevention efforts, some pests may already be present or find ways inside. A professional pest inspection before winter can:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Identify existing pest problems before they worsen</li>
        <li>Spot potential entry points you might have missed</li>
        <li>Provide targeted treatments for current infestations</li>
        <li>Apply preventative barriers to protect your home all winter</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Common Winter Pests in Richlands</h3>
      
      <h4>Rodents (Rats and Mice)</h4>
      <p>Seek warm shelter and can cause significant damage by chewing wires, insulation, and contaminating food.</p>
      
      <h4>Spiders</h4>
      <p>Including dangerous species like redbacks, they move indoors seeking warmth and prey.</p>
      
      <h4>Cockroaches</h4>
      <p>German and American cockroaches thrive in warm indoor environments during winter.</p>
      
      <h4>Silverfish</h4>
      <p>Love damp, dark areas and can damage books, wallpaper, and clothing.</p>
      
      <h3>Why Winter Pest Control Matters</h3>
      <p>Winter pest prevention isn't just about comfort—it's about protecting your health and property:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Health protection:</strong> Pests carry diseases and trigger allergies</li>
        <li><strong>Property damage:</strong> Rodents can cause thousands in damage to wiring and structures</li>
        <li><strong>Cost savings:</strong> Prevention is far cheaper than treating a full infestation</li>
        <li><strong>Peace of mind:</strong> Sleep better knowing your home is protected</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Take Action Now</h3>
      <p>Don't wait until you see pests to take action. Winter-proofing your Richlands home now will save you stress, money, and potential health risks later.</p>
      
      <p>Start with these four strategies today, and if you need professional help or want a comprehensive pest inspection, our licensed technicians are ready to help.</p>

      <h2>Complete Home Maintenance Guide for Richlands Properties</h2>
      <p>Your Richlands home is one of your most valuable assets. Regular maintenance not only protects your investment but also prevents costly emergency repairs, maintains property value, and ensures your family's safety and comfort. This comprehensive guide covers essential maintenance tasks every Richlands homeowner should follow.</p>
      
      <h3>Why Regular Home Maintenance Matters</h3>
      <p>Brisbane's subtropical climate, with its hot, humid summers and mild winters, creates unique challenges for Richlands homeowners. High humidity promotes mold growth, heavy rainfall can cause drainage issues, and warm temperatures attract pests year-round. A proactive maintenance schedule addresses these challenges before they become expensive problems.</p>
      
      <h3>Monthly Maintenance Checklist</h3>
      
      <h4>Pest Inspection</h4>

      <h3>Summer Pest Prevention (December-February)</h3>
      <p>Summer is peak pest season in Brisbane. High temperatures and humidity create ideal conditions for pest breeding and activity.</p>
      
      <h4>Common Summer Pests</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Ants:</strong> Colonies expand rapidly, seeking food and water indoors</li>
        <li><strong>Cockroaches:</strong> Breed quickly in warm, humid conditions</li>
        <li><strong>Mosquitoes:</strong> Breed in standing water after summer storms</li>
        <li><strong>Flies:</strong> Attracted to food waste and organic matter</li>
        <li><strong>Termites:</strong> Highly active, swarming after rain</li>
        <li><strong>Wasps:</strong> Build nests in eaves and outdoor structures</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>Summer Prevention Strategies</h4>
      
      <p><strong>Food and Water Management:</strong></p>
      <ul>

      </ul>
      
      <h3>Winter Pest Prevention (June-August)</h3>
      <p>While pest activity decreases in winter, Brisbane's mild climate means many pests remain active, especially indoors.</p>
      
      <h4>Common Winter Pests</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Rodents:</strong> Peak indoor activity seeking warmth</li>

    title: 'Lice Treatment and Prevention',
    date: '2024-11-13',
    category: 'Pest Control',
    content: `
      <h2>Understanding Lice in Richlands Homes</h2>
      <p>Lice are highly specialised external parasites of birds and mammals. They belong to Order Phthiraptera, which comprises of 3000 species worldwide, and around 200 are represented in Australia.</p>
      
      <p>Adult lice are 1.5 – 3.5 mm long; they are wingless and have a flattened body shape. The antennae are usually short, they have small compound eyes, and legs usually carry conspicuous claws, this claw help with movement among hair.</p>
      
      <h3>Life Cycle</h3>
      <p>Lice undergo a gradual metamorphosis. The eggs are sometimes called "nits" and are usually glued to their host's hair or in the case of body louse they are found in the seams of clothing that are in close contact with the body.</p>
      
      <p>The eggs can hatch in 5-10 days, and nymphs feed on blood from the host, they usually pass through three instars before reaching maturity. The life cycle can take 3-4 weeks. Adults live for about a month, in this time the female may lay around 200 eggs.</p>
      
      <h3>Habits</h3>
      <p>Lice spend their entire life on the host; both sexes and all developmental stages are obligate bloodsuckers and can feed intermittently throughout the day or night.</p>
      
      <p>The head louse is mostly associated with the hair of the head. Lice are sensitive to temperature and tend to leave a dead or dying host to seek another. Temperature and smell play an important part in host detection. Lice can spread when there is close contact between hosts.</p>
      
      <p>Body lice feeding involve breaking the skin and injecting saliva. This can cause irritation and scratching, in severe cases this can lead to local infection of bite wounds.</p>
      
      <h3>Control of Lice</h3>
      <p>Where a louse infestation has been discovered, persons that have been in contact with the infested person should be checked out immediately, as this can limit the spread.</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Frequent bathing and washing with soap and water</li>
        <li>Frequent changing of underwear</li>
        <li>Clothing and bedding should be washed in hot water</li>
        <li>Steam cleaning of carpets, upholstery, mattresses are advisable</li>
        <li>Special designed combs can give partial control of head lice</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Bird Lice</h3>
      <p>Lice can be brought into a home from birds. Birds will nest in the roof void of a home and are carriers of lice. The most susceptible type of home for harbouring lice is the Queenslander.</p>
      
      <p>Once the lice have made home in the roof, they can find their way into the rest of the home by cracks around the ceiling or even from down lights in the roof. To successfully treat lice, the roof void needs to be treated. This is done by using an electric blower to fill the roof with a permethrin dust.</p>
      
      <p>Gaps and excess holes need to be fixed to prevent any birds from nesting within the roof void once the treatment has been completed.</p>

    title: 'Carpet Beetle Control Guide',
    date: '2024-11-14',
    category: 'Pest Control',
    content: `
      <h2>Understanding Carpet Beetles</h2>
      <p>Like clothes moths, carpet beetles have a marked preference for materials of animal origin, but they will attack a wider range of materials than clothes moths.</p>
      
      <p>Carpet beetle larvae may feed on or in wool, fur, hair, silk, clothes, fabrics, carpets, rugs, underfelts, felts, fibre-type insulation, dried insect specimens, animal carcasses, bee and wasp nests and stored foods including dried meats, seeds, grains and cereals.</p>
      
      <h3>Signs of Infestation</h3>
      <p>The presence of flying or crawling adult carpet beetles may indicate the presence of an infestation. Sighting of damaged materials, sand-like larval droppings, bristly cast skins and perhaps live larvae will confirm activity.</p>
      
      <h3>Control of Carpet Beetles</h3>
      <p>Where an infestation of carpet beetles requires treatment, it is important that a thorough and extensive inspection be carried out in the premises. If treatment is directed merely towards localised and obvious feeding areas, less obvious feeding areas may continue to supply adults to the rest of the premises after treatment.</p>
      
      <h3>Non Chemical Control</h3>
      <p>Hygiene plays an important role in the prevention of fabric pests. The vacuuming or cleaning of carpets, rugs, upholstery should be thorough and frequent.</p>
      
      <p>Attention to carpet edges and down behind seat cushions, such areas are often neglected, and with the build up of dust and skin scales, they are often sites of infestation.</p>
      
      <p>When clothes are to be stored for some time, they should be thoroughly cleaned and dried then wrapped up tightly in plastic before storage. Clothes should never be stored in a soiled state for any length of time.</p>
      
      <h3>Professional Treatment</h3>
      <p>When Astra Pest Control is hired to rid your home of carpet beetles, we first do an inspection of each room. This will give us a good idea as to how much damage has been caused and what treatment we should do.</p>
      
      <p>There are two main treatments for carpet beetles that we have found to work very well:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Apply a liquid insecticide down around the edges of the carpet. This is the most common place to find carpet beetles (Anthrenocerus australis).</li>
        <li>Apply a permethrin dust underneath the carpet and underlay. This is done with a specially designed nozzle that attaches to an electric blower.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <p>Astra Pest Control also gives a full warranty on our services. This gives our customers peace of mind, knowing they have hired a professional pest controller to get rid of carpet beetles from their home.</p>
