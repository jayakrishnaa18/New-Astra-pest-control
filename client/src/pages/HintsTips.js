          <h2>Vacuum Your Carpets?</h2>
          <p>Do you know that you should vacuum your carpets regularly, at least twice every week? Most people don't vacuum enough! Dirt gets easily embedded into carpet fibres, and using a vacuum that has a rotating brush or "power head" on the highest floor setting is the best way to go. Vacuuming your carpet frequently is an absolute must if you want it to have a long life.</p>

          <h2>Choose a Quality Carpet Cleaner?</h2>
          <p>To choose a quality carpet cleaner, you first have to see what sort of equipment they use. But you don't get to see this until they arrive, which is too late by then. Most carpet cleaners who use a switch and bait tactics to push up the price are inexperienced carpet cleaners.</p>
          <p>Best 1 is an expert carpet cleaning business in Brisbane has been in business for 15 years and has invested in powerful truck mounted machines and high powered portable hot water extraction machines. When a cleaner uses an old machine, they leave a sticky residue in your carpets/upholstery, which will attract dust. It's this dust that makes carpets/upholstery re-soil faster than it would if a professional technician did the clean.</p>

          </div>
          <p>At Best 1, we have a last step injection process on our truck mounted and portable steam cleaning machines that flushes out all of the pre-spray and detergents that have been used to clean the carpets with, leaving the carpets/upholstery feeling fresh and clean again.</p>
          <p>Don't be fooled! Ask your cleaner how long they have been in business and look for before and after pictures and videos on their websites. this way you can see what you are getting before booking. Also do an ABN search and find out for yourself. Ask if they have insurance.</p>
          <p>Don't forget, Best 1 Cleaning and Pest Control & Pest Control is here to help. We want your repeat business and that's how we've built our business.</p>

          <h2>Control Ants at Your Place</h2>
          <p>Ants will use your wheelie bins as a great source of food. All the rubbish we throw out each day ants love. It's easy food for them and you will never stop this no matter how hard you try.</p>
          <p>The best thing to do is try and put all the rubbish into plastic bags before putting it into the wheelie bin. The best thing of all is keep the wheelie bin away from the house. This seems like an obvious thing to do, but some people still leave the wheelie bin close to the house.</p>
          <p>If you leave the bin close to the house, this is another easy way for ants to get into your home. At least once a year, give the wheelie bin a good clean. Just put some dish washing liquid into the bin and turn on the hose and then rinse out easy.</p>
